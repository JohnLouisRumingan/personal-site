            Personal Site for John-Louis Rumingan.

            Page built using CSS and HTML. Rehaul of site using React/Redux.

                Please note: This website is a single-page app using react-router-dom Link components.
                However, due to github.io's method of allowing react repositories, copy/pasting the 
                URL will not actually work to view specific links - for now. 
            </p>
